# project_Figure Skating result data analysis 
Game data has been collected and studied to help analyst to understand the sports self. Data Visualization has been brought to sports field. It has been studies in basketball,
baseball, hockey and so on. Numerous data has been extracted from the pitch, the court into some forms of lines and shapes. This helps people draw useful information, which can be used in building sports strategies. However, sports visualization has not been touched with figure skating. Figure skating is valued by a bunch of numerical value, although it is one of the most artistic sports. A single skater usually have 4 to 6 competition in a season, and during each competition, he will perform two programs. In total, there will be 21 technical elements, plus with five component scores, while each of these will be given 9 sub scores by judge panel. There are a lot of available data can be used to study, however, currently, there is only one simple table format used to present the data. This project aims to visualize the original result data using different
representations, and help users better understand the skater’s performance through numerical data. Data includes rich hidden information. Shape and lines exposure all the needed information. Users can play with the data using this system, understanding skate’s performance and judges’
evaluation comprehensively.
